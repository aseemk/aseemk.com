### Tips, Tricks, and Lessons Learned

[Aseem Kishore](http://aseemk.com/)<br/>
Jan–Nov 2013<br/>
</section>
<aside>
Hi guys. My name is [Aseem Kishore](http://aseemk.com/). I'm a developer at a startup here in NYC called [FiftyThree](http://www.fiftythree.com/). We make an iPad app called [Paper](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper).

Before I joined FiftyThree, I built a startup with a friend called [The Thingdom](http://www.thethingdom.com/), which was a social network around products. Early on in The Thingdom's life, we decided to build on [Neo4j](http://www.neo4j.org/), a graph database. And since every choice you make when you're a startup (especially early on) is literally "betting the company", choosing to build on a graph database was definitely a significant one.

Over this talk, I'll share some of the lessons we learned along the way, but I'll also cover the basics around graph databases generally and Neo4j specifically.

If you aren't familiar with [FiftyThree](http://www.fiftythree.com/) or [Paper](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper), definitely check it out.

It's worth noting that I can't take any of the credit for Paper's quality or success. That's all the amazing work of the other folks at FiftyThree. I'm leading the development of our next product, which we haven't announced yet.

This was [The Thingdom](http://www.thethingdom.com/). Check it out, too, to get a sense of what it was.

I built The Thingdom with my friend and co-founder, [Daniel Gasienica](http://gasi.ch/). This is him (and his photography gear) pictured here.

When Daniel and I started building The Thingdom, neither of us had had any significant experience working with relational databases.

We had some solid experience using a key-value store: we had built this "bit.ly for high-res images" type of site and service called [Zoom.it](http://zoom.it/). But early on, we realized that a highly partitioned key-value store didn't quite make sense for a social network like we were building with The Thingdom. After all, how do you partition arbitrarily-connected data? We didn't know.
</aside>

<section class="small-img-portrait">
![](/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/calvin-hobbes-ignorance.jpg)
</section>
<aside>
So we did what (hopefully?) any other ignorant and naive pair of developers would do: we googled it. Surely in the era of Facebook's Graph API, this must be a solved problem.

We expected to just find techniques and best practices explaining how to use either a regular relational db or a key-value store to implement a graph, but we were surprised to hear that there were actually dedicated "graph databases" for this kind of data.

<section>
[![](/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/neo4j-viz.png)](http://www.neo4j.org/)
</section>
<aside>
There appeared to be a bunch of options, and we settled on what has turned out to be the most mainstream one, [Neo4j](http://www.neo4j.org/). We tried it, and we liked it, so we decided to stick with it. And it turned out to be a great choice.

In fact, I've often said that this decision was probably the *best* technology choice we made. Not because of scale or anything like that, but simply because it let us build our *app* and focus on the user experience rather than the format of the data being stored.

</section>
<aside>
It sounds cliche, but we were truly able to translate whiteboard sketches directly to our data model, with no (or minimal) futzing in between. And that meant that we were able to crank out features and iterate rapidly on them. The simple programming model and schemaless structure were key factors here.
</aside>

<section>
![](/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/thingdom-recommendations.png)
</section>
<aside>
For example, we were able to not only show recommendations for people you might like to follow, but also show *why* we were recommending those people to you (e.g. their followers that were also your following) -- all in real-time.
</aside>

<section>
<script type="text/markdown">
```
START user=node(1), other=node(2)
MATCH (user) -[r1:has|wants]-> (thing) <-[r2:has|wants]- (other)
WHERE TYPE(r1) <> TYPE(r2)
RETURN TYPE(r1), TYPE(r2), thing
```

<img class="fragment" src="/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/thingdom-mutual-things.png" />
</script>
</section>
<aside>
We were also able to easily implement more advanced features (even if we never got around to implementing the UI/UX for those features -- that was always the hard part and the bottleneck for us), like helping you discovering things you have that another person wants (or vice versa).

With Neo4j, we were able to not only express these kinds of questions with straightforward queries,  we were also able to *answer* those questions efficiently, often in real-time again.

So that was pretty exciting, and potentially even a source of competitive advantage if we found success with such features.

But more than anything, this was my favorite technology choice because it simply made us happy and productive. We never dreaded schema upgrades or struggled over table design. Using a graph database was just *fun* -- and you can't underestimate the importance of that when doing a startup.

<!-- WHAT IS A GRAPH DB -->

<section>
# So…
## &nbsp;
# Just what is a
# <span class="positive">graph database</span>?
</section>

<section class="small-img-landscape">
![](/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/GraphDatabase_PropertyGraph.png)
</section>
<aside>
"Graph database" obviously implies that the database stores data in a graph format or that it's optimized for graph operations.

Generally, graph databases store "property graphs" -- which means nodes and relationships can have properties attached to them. You can think of nodes and
relationships as "records" then, kind of like rows in a table.

Graph datbases also generally label relationships -- it's the one "type" or "schema" that graph databases need to know about.

(Pic from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_databases))
</aside>

<section id="graph-representations">
<script type="text/markdown">
&nbsp;

    # adjacency list:
    nodes = List<Node>
    neighbors = Map<Node, List<Node>>
    neighbors[node1].add(node2)

    # adjacency matrix:
    nodes = List<Node>
    connections = Map<Node, Map<Node, bool>>
    connections[node1][node2] = true

&nbsp;
</script>
</section>
<aside>
There are generally two main ways to represent a graph, and indeed, a graph
database would probably store the graph (at a high level) in one of these two ways.

An "adjacency list" representation keeps track of each node's neighbors (which are nodes here, but would probably be relationships to nodes in practice), whereas an "adjacency matrix" representation tracks whether any given pair of nodes are neighbors (or more precisely again, have one or more relationships connecting them).

Adjacency lists are optimized for sparse graphs, while adjacency matrices are optimized for dense graphs. Most graph databases would probably then store an adjacency list, since the density of the graph won't be known in advance.

</section>
<aside>
And indeed, that's how Neo4j stores its data. It happens to use doubly-linked lists for everything, but the idea is the same: for each node, there's a list of its incoming and outgoing relationships.

Neo4j also uses fixed-size records for both nodes and relationships, with each record offset by its ID, so that if you know the ID of a node or relationship, a direct lookup is O(1). To achieve the fixed-size records, the records contain only "head" pointers to their linked lists.

This is really useful to know, because it shows you a few properties of Neo4j (and maybe graph databases in general):

- It's great at localized searches. E.g. to get the people you follow, it just needs to follow your node's linked list of relationships -- and the performance of this won't change if there are 100 people globally or 1M.

- It's not great at aggregation. E.g. the nodes or relationships aren't stored in any sorted order, so deriving the 20 most popular users requires a full scan.

- It suffers from the "supernode problem". At least currently, a node's neighboring relationships are stored as a flat list, so if you have a million followers, fetching even one person you follow is slow. This could be solved by storing neighbors as a hash table or a B-tree, but there are other trade-offs then, too. We'll come back to this.

</section>
<aside>
Graph data can also be stored in a relational database, of course. Here's how a simple graph might translate between the two. And this is what shows the localized aspect of graph databases so clearly: the relationships between `foo` and `bar` require a lookup in a large single table in the relational representation, but they're stored local to `foo` and `bar` in the graph representation.

(Slide from [Andreas Kollegger](https://twitter.com/akollegger) I believe, another Neo4j engineer; retrieved from [systay.github.com](http://systay.github.com/blog/2011/11/06/cypher---a-view-from-a-recovering-sql-dba/))

</section>
<aside>
And here's where we get to the "formal" definition of a graph database: it's a database that provides *"index-free adjacency"*. Every element contains a direct pointer to its neighbors, not requiring a global index lookup in between. You could also think of these as "local" indices.

![](/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/thingdom-graph-basic.png)
</section>
<aside>
Here's the basic social graph for The Thingdom. It's pretty straightforward, but note how the relationship names are unique and expressive -- they tell you how two nodes relate, and they let you easily find one type of node from another.
</aside>

<section class="learned">
# What we learned

<ul>
<li>Unique, expressive <strong>relationship types</strong></li>
</ul>
</section>
<aside>
Sounds simple, but that's an important lesson that was reinforced to us over and over. It's tempting to stay "pure" by using "simple" names like `likes` and `follows` and `author` everywhere, but don't overload them. It's always easy to query for both types of relationships when the names are different (just an `OR` in Cypher), but it's not possible to (efficiently) query for just one type when the names are the same.

E.g. at some point, we were considering letting people "follow" categories/brands too, but we resisted the temptation to reuse the `follows` relationship name. If we had, we wouldn't have been able to efficiently traverse just the *users* someone followed, or vice versa.

And again, the way Neo4j stores data on disk, the relationship type is the only way it knows during a traversal whether to visit a node or not. Unique and expressive relationship types can save you a lot in performance.
</aside>

<section class="small-img-portrait">
![](/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/thingdom-people-stats.png)
</section>
<aside>
Like any social network, we also obviously wanted to show users' stats whenever we showed a list of users.
</aside>

<section>
![](/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/thingdom-graph-stats.png)
</section>
<aside>
But it obviously wouldn't be performant to fetch all these followers and things for each user every time.
</aside>

<section class="small-img-landscape">
![](/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/webadmin-user-stats.png)
</section>
<aside>
So we cached those numbers as properties on user nodes, e.g. `numFollowers` and `numThings`.
</aside>

<section class="learned">
# What we learned

<ul>
<li>Unique, expressive <strong>relationship types</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cache stats</strong> where possible</li>
</ul>
</section>
<aside>
Again, simple enough, but it makes a dramatic difference, so don't forget that.

This applies at each level, though, both per-node (e.g. each user's `numFollowers`) and globally (e.g. the most popular categories; these could be cached as relationships from the root node, or those nodes could be indexed).

Avoid expensive traversals and aggregations wherever you can.
</aside>

<section>
![](/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/thingdom-graph-events.png)
</section>
<aside>
I showed earlier that our basic graph was that users were connected to things through `has` and `wants` relationships. That worked fine for the present -- this moment in time -- but how does that work over time, when those relationships can change?

E.g. a user wants the new iPhone before it's out, then when it's out, he/she gets one, then months later, he/she loses it by accident, etc.

We obviously want traversals to be efficient when we're querying e.g. who wants this iPhone, or what things does a user have. But we may also want to "remember" that history, as we did.

To achieve both those things, we settled on a philosophy that worked well for us: we decided that relationships reflect the "state of the world" at this moment in time, and *event nodes* could be used to capture history.

So in this case, we came up with "have/want event" nodes, which, like `has` and `want` relationships, connected users with things, but also stored (as properties on the node) the type of change (e.g. `has` &rarr; `wants`).

This was better than e.g. keeping relationships around forever and storing `deleted` properties on relationships we should ignore, because traversal performance would have suffered.
</aside>

<section class="learned">
# What we learned

<ul>
<li>Unique, expressive <strong>relationship types</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cache stats</strong> where possible</li>
<li>Capture history through <strong>event nodes</strong></li>
</ul>
</section>
<aside>
So if that works for your domain too, consider keeping relationships lean in number and simple -- just the state of the world -- and capture history through "event" nodes, which can be ignored for "now" queries.
</aside>

<section>
![](/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/thingdom-graph-suggestions.png)
</section>
<aside>
But we also learned another lesson from that experience: we noticed that these event nodes let us (and our users) do things we couldn't do with the simple `has` and `wants` relationships. Other users could "like" an event node, or comment on it, or be @mentioned by a decsription on it.

That taught us another important lesson: nodes let something truly be "first-class" in a way that relationships couldn't. And that's simply because relationships can't point to other relationships.

(These are known as "hyperedges" in graph terminology. Some graph databases may support them, but Neo4j doesn't. I used to wish that it did, but I'm realizing that ultimately, it's not a big deal, since you can easily achieve hyperedges with node and relationship "primitives" like this.)

So at some point, when we implemented a feature to let users suggest things to other users ("Alice thinks you might have or want an iPhone"), we had no choice but to implement those suggestions as nodes (since they connected three nodes, not just two), but we were happy to do so, since that again let us do "first-class" things with them, like letting other users comment on them. Win-win.
</aside>

<section class="learned">
# What we learned

<ul>
<li>Unique, expressive <strong>relationship types</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cache stats</strong> where possible</li>
<li>Capture history through <strong>event nodes</strong></li>
<li>First-class objects ⇒ <strong>nodes</strong>, not rels</li>
</ul>
</section>
<aside>
So remember that relationships are limited to connecting just two nodes. If you're modeling something that you may want to support multiple connections to, make it a first-class node.
</aside>

<section>
![](/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/webadmin-thing-categories.png)
</section>
<aside>
We made a similar mistake when it came to curation/categorization: we took the shortcut of adding a category *property* (and in this case, a brand property, too) to our thing nodes. After all, we figured that would still let us query and derive things' categories, and we could even (auto-)index those properties.

However, we again ran into limitations as we realized that properties are equally not "first-class" citizens of the graph. At one point, we wanted to rename a category (from "Movies & TV" to "Movies/TV"); that rename meant a forklift effort of updating every node with that property value, and deploying code that could read the old name but wrote the new name, etc.
</aside>

<section>
![](/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/thingdom-graph-categories.png)
</section>
<aside>
What's pictured here is what we *should* have done: have nodes for categories (and brands), and have thing nodes connected to those category nodes. That would have let us even have a hierarchy of categories/subcategories, like pictured here.

With this, renaming that category would have been as simple as updating one node — with no code changes. But there would have been other benefits too: e.g. users could then like or follow brands or categories, have discussions under them, etc.
</aside>

<section class="learned">

<li>Connected data ⇒ <strong>nodes</strong>, not props</li>
</ul>
</section>
<aside>
So again, if something in your data model is important enough to warrant working with, consider making it a "first-class" node. But in this case, if it's also *connected* data, like our categories were, it should definitely be a node, not a property.
</aside>

<section id="linked-list-feed">
<img src="/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/thingdom-graph-feed-1.png" />
<img class="fragment" src="/images/neo4j-lessons-learned/thingdom-graph-feed-2.png" />
</section>
<aside>
Finally, maybe the most important lesson we learned was around our activity feed implementation. This was probably the most important lesson because it's not necessarily obvious if you're new to graphs / graph databases, but it's also one of the most fundamental.

As we saw with Neo4j's file format, the performance of traversing a node's relationships scales linearly with the number of those relationships. Having unique, expressive types on those relationships lets you cut down on the number of *nodes* that are visited, but each of the *relationships* must still be visited, because the relationships are (currently, at least) all stored as one, flat list.

So when a node starts to have many, many relationships, efficient traversal becomes a problem for that node. This is called the **supernode problem**. And this is indeed what happens when you implement "event" nodes for users like we did: the number of relationships for a user keeps growing and growing (because the number of event nodes they're connected to keeps growing and growing).

So when we implemented our activity feed, we went the simple/naive way of using a Cypher aggregation on users' event nodes: essentially, an `ORDER BY` followed a `LIMIT`. This meant that Neo4j had to traverse every relationship -- *and* visit every event node -- in order to determine the top (most recent) events. This kind of aggregation is obviously not making good use of a graph database, and we saw how this didn't scale as our data grew.

This picture shows what we *should* have done: make use of the most basic graph data structure -- a linked list. We should have maintained a linked list for each user's events, and appended to (the front of) it on each new event for that user. This would let us follow just the first 10 (or 20, or whatever) relationships -- a constant number instead of growing with the number of events.

The supernode problem still exists for the first relationship, since the user node has many relationships. The Neo4j team has plans to remove this problem by reworking the file format (e.g. storing a node's relationships as a hash table or B-tree instead of a flat list), but until then, you can simply use a global index: for each user, index the "head" relationship for that user to his/her most recent event node.

Hat-tip to [René Pickhardt](http://www.rene-pickhardt.de/) for opening my eyes to this approach through his work on [Graphity](http://www.rene-pickhardt.de/graphity-an-efficient-graph-model-for-retrieving-the-top-k-news-feeds-for-users-in-social-networks/), a project which applies the same idea to *aggregate* feeds as well.

# What we learned

<ul>
<li>Unique, expressive <strong>relationship types</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cache stats</strong> where possible</li>
<li>Capture history through <strong>event nodes</strong></li>
<li>First-class objects ⇒ <strong>nodes</strong>, not rels</li>
<li>Connected data ⇒ <strong>nodes</strong>, not props</li>
<li>Maintain <strong>linked lists</strong> for O(1) queries</li>
</ul>
</section>
<aside>
And that's the last major lesson we learned for making the most of a graph database. This approach of storing linked lists is also sometimes referred to as creating secondary "in-graph" indexes.

Going forward, we're pretty excited for a few improvements and developments coming down the pipe in Neo4j 2.0 and beyond.

- Nodes will be able to have optional "labels" (analagous to relationship types), and auto-indexing will be much more tightly integrated into the database with "constraints" attached to labels. This'll be huge.

- They're aware of the supernode problem and have plans to fix it, as I mentioned. Storing relationships as a map or B-tree will go a long way, but I understand there are trade-offs to any representation.

- Cypher continues to improve at an impressive pace, but with 2.0, you're able to group multiple Cypher queries — potentially even across multiple HTTP/REST requests — into a single transaction. This is big for consistency and robustness.

- Graphs aren't trivially partitionable, as I mentioned, but if anyone has the knowledge to figure out how to do it heuristically — and connect the pieces together — it should be a graph database. I believe they're already working on this problem, which is pretty cool.

Overall, it's been great to grow with Neo4j and be a part of the community, and we're still as excited as ever for its future.

**Update:** the Neo4j team in fact just published a blog post on this stuff! [What's coming next in Neo4j](http://blog.neo4j.org/2013/01/2013-whats-coming-next-in-neo4j.html)

And that's that!

So check out [FiftyThree](http://www.fiftythree.com/) and [Paper](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper) again if you haven't already. We're very much looking forward to shipping what we're building with this tech.
