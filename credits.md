I wouldn’t be where I am today without the help and support of many other people. Here are some of them.

### Families

- **My parents**. Where do I begin? I'm immensely grateful for the way you guys raised me and the opportunities you both afforded me. I literally owe my life to you guys. Thanks, Mom and Dad.

- **My brother, Anant**. That I got to grow up with an older brother is one of the things I'm most thankful for. I had a constant best friend, partner in crime, and role model — a younger brother can't ask for much more.

- **My grandmothers, Amma and Nani**. It couldn't have been easy seeing your grandkids growing up halfway across the world and speaking a different language. Thanks for being there for us so frequently.

- **Bua, Fufaji, Chacha, Chachi, Askhay, Appar**, and the rest of our **extended family**. I hope we can continue to help and support each other over each of the next generations just as we have over this one.

- All of our **family friends** in Lucknow, Bareilly, Raipur, Atlanta, Buffalo, Lacrosse, Chicago, Seattle, and more. They say it takes a village to raise a child; I was fortunate to have several.

- **Jenny**. Where do I begin here too? Meeting you was one of the luckiest things that happened to me, and you've been the pillar of my life these past five years. Here's to the next five.

- **Andy, Mr., and Mrs. Liu**. You guys have welcomed me into your lives and homes with open arms. Maybe I'll even technically be family one day? ;)

- **FiftyThree**, esp. **Georg, Julian, Andrew, Jon, and John**. I'm deeply appreciative that you guys took a chance on me and trusted me to build a major part of our company's future. I'm proud to be part of this family.

- **Chris, Garrett, Dave, Danish**, and honorary members **Lauren** and **Daniela**. You guys are my NYC family, and it's been a blast experiencing this city with you all.

### The Thingdom

- **Daniel**. You were one of the best co-founders one could ask for. It was a pleasure and a privilege bringing the idea to life with you; thanks, buddy. Maybe we can repeat the experience sometime. ;)

- **Sanjay**. You literally made the experience possible with your logistical support, but I also appreciate the nudge you gave me to leave Microsoft to start something new. The trip to India was a life-changer. Thank you!

- **Jeremy**. You took a leap of faith on me, and I appreciate that greatly. It didn't ultimately work out as we hoped it would, but I still found the experience incredibly valuable, and I hope you did too.

- **Sergio**. I was an ineffective leader when we started, but you contributed nonetheless, and more importantly, you remained friendly a year later. Thanks, Sergio. Your character is without match.

- **Our users**, esp. **Frida, Boris, Gerd, Danish, Ian, Amanda Smith, Andrew Miner, and Tiff Ting**. You guys were the biggest source of motivation for us. Thanks for the feedback and support; you pushed us forward.

- The founders at **Crocodoc**, **FutureAdvisor**, **Venuetastic**, and **Moki.tv**. Thanks for the YC interview prep — we really appreciated it. You all have my deep admiration and respect; good luck, and keep on truckin'.

- **Y Combinator**. We didn't get in, but just the experience of applying was invaluable. It was also a useful reminder of adversity, and for me personally, it was perhaps my first real taste of humble pie.

- The **StartLabs crew**: **Paulina, Zach, Chris, and Ariadne**. You guys put together a great program, and you should be proud. Thanks for accepting us and giving us an IAP to remember.

- Our **StartLabs advisors**: **Nicole**, **Nitesh**, **Mina**, **Brad Feld**, and esp. **Kent**. Thanks for listening, helping, and mentoring. Kent, I'm especially grateful for how much you gave us when we needed it. Thank you.

- Everyone else who provided advice or guidance along the way: **Lawrence Coburn**, **Ian Gilman**, **Jay Gairson**, **Gary Flake**, **Ken Perkins**, **Matt Jubelirer**, **Max Krohn**, **Ayush Agarwal**, **Jules Walter**, **Ele Ocholi**, **Susan Song**, et al. I sincerely appreciate all the input you guys gave me.

- The **developers and open-source communities** whose work we built on: **git**, **GitHub**, **Node.js**, **NPM**, **Express**, **CoffeeScript**, but esp. **Neo4j**, **Streamline.js (Bruno Jouhier)** and **DotCloud**.

### The Great Nomadic Adventure

At the end of October 2011, I left Seattle (with only my laptop, a suitcase of clothes, and my trombone) and traveled to San Francisco. I intended to relocate there to focus more fully on The Thingdom, but fate would have me there for less than a month.

I spent that month and the next seven traveling between San Francisco, New York, Boston, and Seattle, staying most of that time with friends gracious enough to host me. I finally settled into my current place in New York (and received the rest of my stuff) in July 2012.

These are the people whose help went above and beyond. Thanks, guys.

- **Josh, Guy, Daniel,** and **Jenny**, for holding onto my stuff while I moved.

- **Karan**, for being a great partner in our (looong!) drive down, and taking care of all the organizational details. Maybe we'll do the coast one day --- but not in a U-Haul this time. ;)

- **Spenser & Curtis (& Karena & Jenny)**, for letting me crash, introducing me to the Bay Area, driving me to Startup School, and even bringing me out for (the awesomely fun) Zombie Tag.

- **Ed (& TODO)**, for letting me crash, introducing me to SF, even giving me a spare key. Also, for letting me have some of that super tasty homemade pumpkin pie. Mmm, pie.

- **Nicholas & Nancy**, for going out of your way to let me crash in your beautiful home even as you guys were leaving the country! (I was definitely  nervous I'd accidentally break something.)

- **Jeremy**, for letting me crash for nearly a whole month as we worked together, for introducing me to NYC and your friends, and of course... for NBA Jam. He's on fire!

- **Ele**, for letting me crash twice. It's always so great catching up with you. I'm ready to return the favor, btw, whenever you take the leap, too... ;)

- **Gabe**, for letting me crash twice, too, and for bringing me out to a Celtics game! What I wrote for Ele above applies to you as well, btw!

- And last --- and in fact the most --- **Julian**, for graciously giving me your apartment for an unbelievable 2.5 months, and **Grace**, for hosting Julian in return. I know this was a huge adjustment for you guys; thank you. And thanks also for welcoming me so warmly and introducing me to Jersey City. Who knew New Jersey could be so... decent?!
