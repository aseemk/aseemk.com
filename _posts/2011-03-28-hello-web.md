It's been [a few years][mit-website] since I've had a website to call my own.
That's certainly ironic, given that I call myself a [web developer][projects].

[projects]: /projects/

Most of those few years for me were spent at [Microsoft Live Labs][livelabs-wp],
home to some amazing people that built some equally [amazing technology][livelabs-gasi].
At Live Labs, my thoughts and ideas were all public, whether through emails or
frequent show-and-tells like those at the end of our [out-of-the-box weeks][ootb-jeff].
It was a very special community.

Now that Live Labs is no more, I've been longing to be a part of another such community,
and what better one is there than the web at large? I'm especially inspired by [GitHub][github];
I was hooked the moment I made my first [push][first-push],
my first [fork][first-fork], my first [pull request][first-pull-req].

[github]: https://github.com/
[first-push]: https://github.com/aseemk/seadragon-ajax/commit/f20c8c389862866f70ce17caf36da8cd79a3f4c0
[first-fork]: https://github.com/aseemk/iscroll
[first-pull-req]: https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll/pull/19

So this is my [introduction][about]. I'll be sharing my thoughts and ideas here,
and with your help, I hope we can make the web an even better place.

Special thanks to [Daniel Gasienica][gasi] for encouraging me to create this blog.
He mostly just wanted me to stop sending long emails, though. ;)
