_I [joined Even](/blog/2017/joining-even) in 2017, compelled by the mission and impressed by the founders. I thought I was putting my career on the backburner, not expecting to learn or grow too much, but boy, was I wrong. Over four years, I learned & grew more than I ever expected, as an engineer, manager, leader, and teammate._

_I left Even this month for another opportunity (which I'll share more about soon). Below is an excerpt of the memo I shared internally to express my gratitude._

Dear Even,

As announced in Q&A today, I‚Äôm very sad to say that I‚Äôm leaving Even. üò¢

I never expected to write this so soon! I wasn‚Äôt looking to leave ‚Äî I love everything here from our mission and our culture to my day-to-day work and especially all of you. We‚Äôre also perhaps the best set up for success now, with [David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbaga/), [Sam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantha-goldman/), and [Preston](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prestonjclark/) now on board, than we‚Äôve ever been before. An opportunity just came up for my own personal growth that I ultimately didn‚Äôt want to say no to.

I can‚Äôt express enough gratitude to all of you for how fulfilling you all made these 4 years for me. I especially want to thank [Jon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonschlossberg/), [Quinten](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quintendf/), [Ryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryangomba/), and [Jenny](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenny-molyneaux-bb69b057/) for building something so special and letting me be a part of it, [Olivia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-bishop-a4b9a428/) & [Will](https://www.linkedin.com/in/whilp/) for being such high-caliber peers to work alongside & learn from, every member of my team who gave me the privilege of leading them, and every other engineer & Evener whom I had the pleasure of working or partnering with.

But I especially want to thank [Evan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evangoldschmidt/). Evan has consistently been both one of my biggest supporters and one of my most challenging critics. He never hesitated to praise & thank me for what I did well, but also never hesitated to push me to do & be better. And even when his feedback was uncomfortable, it was usually valid ‚Äî and it always thoughtful and well-intentioned. Most importantly, he gave me so much opportunity to thrive, through ownership, sponsorship, and mentorship, for which I‚Äôm so grateful. I‚Äôve learned & grown way more at Even than I ever expected to ‚Äî and that‚Äôs in largest part thanks to Evan. Thank you, Evan.

The opportunity that I‚Äôm leaving for is to lead all of engineering at another (earlier-stage) startup, so I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reflecting on my lessons learned at Even and what I want to take from my experience here and bring there. I‚Äôve already written >50 lines of notes, and every day I keep adding more. Even has set a high bar, and I‚Äôm both so inspired and so daunted by that bar. I can only hope to create something as special as this.

So thank you all again. I wish you all an amazing next chapter, and I hope we all get to cross paths again. ‚ù§Ô∏è
