This past month, I joined a 20-person startup named [Cardless](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cardlesshq/) as their new Head of Engineering. I'm very excited to be here — both for the destination and for the journey.

We’re growing rapidly and [hiring across roles](https://jobs.lever.co/cardless), so I wanted to explain what Cardless does, why I joined, and what our future holds.

There's a lot that I'm excited about, so I've split this up into two parts. This first part focuses on our business, our traction so far, and our potential. The second part (coming soon) will focus on our team, our culture, and how I'd like to help.

## Our mission

**Cardless is a new credit card company**, aiming to reinvent credit cards to be not just *useful*, but also fair, friendly, and *delightful*.

That sounds nice, but what does that actually mean?

## The status quo for consumers

Those of us fortunate to have a high credit score can take for granted our ability to qualify for top credit cards (like the Chase Sapphire Reserve) and to pay off our balance in full every month. But the majority of Americans don't and can't, yet still need access to credit.

Credit cards are issued by *banks*, like Chase and Capital One. (Fun fact: there hasn't been a major new issuer since Capital One launched in 1994. That's 27 years of no new competition! Spoiler alert: we're throwing our hat into the ring; more below.) **These banks make money off of interest and late fees** — so the majority of Americans that don't qualify for top credit cards instead get credit cards with weak benefits, high interest rates, and significant late fees.

## Co-branded credit cards

You might be familiar with the Costco card, Amazon card, Delta card, etc. These are credit cards that you can use anywhere, but that give discounts & rewards at those brands. The cards are still issued by a bank, and still belong to a network (e.g. Visa or Mastercard).

Done well, co-branded credit cards can be a pretty cool win-win for not just the brand, but also the consumer. Brands get increased brand loyalty and can reduced credit card fees, while consumers get meaningful discounts & rewards at brands they already love.

## The status quo for brands

Here's the rub: if co-branded credit cards are so good, why aren't they more popular?

One of Cardless's founders is from Lyft. Lyft wanted to launch their own co-branded credit card — makes sense, I use Lyft all the time. **Lyft built a team and spent years and millions of dollars trying to do this, but couldn't.**

One reason was cost and work. Lyft's bank required Lyft to become experts in risk, underwriting, and even the bank's own legacy systems. Another reason was that Lyft cares a lot about customer experience (as they should), and this credit card did not have a good one. If a customer wanted to dispute a transaction, for example, they’d need to ***mail or fax* a physical letter**.

Lyft's not alone. Other members of the Cardless team come from Airbnb & Uber. Airbnb wanted to do this, too, and they took a long, hard look at what it'd take to do it… before deciding to not even try.

Uber *did* manage to launch an Uber credit card… only to stop offering it a couple of years later, when their issuing bank started **auto-rejecting applicants with high credit scores** — since that bank wouldn't make any money from people who didn't carry a balance.

(This is what you see today when you Google ["Uber credit card"](https://www.google.com/search?q=uber+credit+card).)

And *that's* the rub: ***banks'* structural incentives are not aligned with brands *or* consumers.** If even top, modern, beloved brands like Lyft & Airbnb can't do this, what hope do other brands have?

## Enter Cardless

We're starting our journey with co-branded credit cards, offering a very simple value prop:

- We make it easy (much easier) for brands to launch their own credit cards. **90 days, $0 setup cost, and headcount of 1** — not 1.5 years, $10M+, and a team of 10.
- These credit cards are amazing for consumers: **no late fees** (or fees of any kind), **the lowest interest rate we ourselves can get**, **fantastic discounts & rewards**, and **best-in-class** (e.g. modern & mobile-first) **customer experience & support**.

Importantly, our business model aligns our incentives with brands & consumers: **we don't make money off of interest or late fees, only transactions.**

Cardless just launched our first two credit cards, starting in the sports vertical, with the [Cleveland Cavaliers](https://www.cardless.com/cavs) and [Manchester United](https://www.cardless.com/manutd). (ManU in particular has co-branded credit cards in many other countries, but had never launched one in the US — until now.)

You can apply today, get a decision instantly in most cases, and if approved, get a **virtual card #** right away (for use online, with Apple Pay, etc.) — which you can also cancel or change anytime in the app. The discounts & rewards are the best the Cavs & ManU have ever offered, and post within a day, not a month. You can dispute charges in **4 taps** (no mailing or faxing anything; this is 2021). And if you need to call us, we'll either answer right away or tell you we'll call back in X minutes.

Cardless founders Michael & Scott wrote two fantastic blog posts diving more into our business and our product:

- [How to make a credit card](https://medium.com/cardlesseng/how-to-make-a-credit-card-dab5f8310bed)
- [Designing for dignity & joy](https://medium.com/cardlesseng/designing-for-dignity-joy-at-cardless-bfb58fa202ef)

## "Social proof"

We just conducted our very first customer survey, and **our [NPS score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter)** ("how likely are you to recommend Cardless to a friend?") is **a staggering 73**. For comparison, legacy banks have NPS scores like -8, while **60+ is the stuff of [Apple](https://www.retently.com/blog/apple-nps/) & [Zappos](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/what-is-a-good-net-promoter-score)**.

![Cardless's NPS score distribution](/images/cardless/cardless-nps-may-2021.png)

We asked customers what we can do to improve their experience, and the most common answer is "nothing". (We know internally we have a ton to improve.) Representative customer quotes include "The app is super easy to navigate," "Great customer service," and (my favorite) "Nice to see banking move into the 21st century."

The industry is starting to take notice too. **"This surprising gem may be the best new no annual fee cash back card on the market,"** [an industry headline reads](https://viewfromthewing.com/machester-united-credit-card/). **"Here's how fintech could disrupt credit card rewards,"** [says another](https://viewfromthewing.com/cardless-may-disrupt-credit-card-rewards/), focusing entirely on us.

And brands are noticing too. We began in the sports vertical, and we're now in talks with several other major league sports teams. We're also now branching out to other verticals, like fitness, fashion, travel, and retail. We're targeting one new card/brand per month this year, which'll be more than every other issuer *combined* — and we look to be on track to getting there.

## Where we're going

We're just getting started, and the real proof will be in the pudding. Will enough consumers find us interesting & useful enough to actually apply & use us? Will enough brands actually partner with us, and will they have enough passionate fans to make our business viable? Will we able to manage our risk and maintain our access to low interest rates?

Only time, work, and ingenuity will tell, but I'm too excited by the opportunity & potential to not help us try.

If we do this well, we're going to achieve a lot more than what we've already achieved so far. Some of our most exciting ideas to me include:

- Offering a **"secured" credit card** for Americans who don't qualify for credit today. This would be like a bank account-backed debit card except it'd **help build credit**. And as a perfect example of the power of aligned incentives, *brands want this*, since many brands have sizable customer populations that wouldn't qualify for co-branded credit cards otherwise.
- Backing our cards with a **diversity of lenders**. Traditional issuers serve only one part of the credit score spectrum. (E.g. Chase targets super-prime, while Capital One targets sub-prime.) This becomes a problem when a brand has customers across that spectrum. As a startup, we can turn a "weakness" — that we can't afford to lend our own money and need to borrow money ourselves — into a competitive advantage. Every time someone applies, we can run an instant auction across multiple lenders to give our customers the best interest rate we can get, ***for every credit score***. This'll help us serve hopefully *all* of a brand's customers, giving them access to hopefully the best rates they'll find anywhere.
- **Experiences that money (literally) can't buy today.** The average American gets only $10/month of rewards value today. (Remember that the average American doesn't qualify for top/fancy credit cards.) That $10 can buy $10 of value if you have points or miles. But the Cavs are excited to offer rewards like getting to meet the team & players, sit on the bench during warm-ups, and maybe even fly on the team jet to an away game someday. These are opportunities that **fans would love** and that **brands could afford**. This is again the power of aligned incentives.

## Why I joined

All of the above is great, but I'm not an investor — I'm an employee. I invest my time & energy wherever I work, and I greatly value day-to-day [happiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDuyqtr3loc). I've turned down multiple lucrative career opportunities over the years because I saw myself being happier elsewhere.

**What drew me to Cardless is that I finally didn't have to pick.** Cardless is an amazing business opportunity with exciting traction and clear potential, *and* it's an amazing company with wonderful people and thoughtful culture.

I'll dive more into those latter things in part 2 — stay tuned.
