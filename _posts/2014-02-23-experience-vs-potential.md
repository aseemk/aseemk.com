I learned to program over ten years before I started college. I taught myself how to make websites and games for fun, and took AP Computer Science *twice*, just to learn Java after they changed from C++.

Of course MIT had kids that had done even more, but it's probably fair to say that whenever hiring season rolled around, I was ahead of the pack. I certainly thought I was worth hiring.
