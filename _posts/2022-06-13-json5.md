[![JSON5](/images/json5/json5-logo.svg)](https://json5.org/)

<!-- {% include image-figure.html src="/images/json5/json5-logo.svg" alt="JSON5" caption="The <a href='https://github.com/json5/json5-logo'>official logo</a> of JSON5, thanks to the excellent <a href='https://github.com/jordanbtucker'>Jordan Tucker</a>." %} -->

Ten years ago, I started [JSON5](https://json5.org/), an open-source project to make one aspect of software engineering a little bit easier.

Today, the project sees [**>50M downloads/week**][npm-json5],
ranks in the [**top 0.1%**][npm-top-500] of packages depended upon in the npm registry[^npm-top-500],
and has been adopted by major projects like [Babel][babel], [Next.js][next.js], [Chromium][chromium], and [more][in-the-wild].

[in-the-wild]: https://github.com/json5/json5/wiki/In-The-Wild

[^npm-top-500]: As of June 2022, the npm registry has roughly [2M packages][npm-2M], and JSON5 is in the [top 500][npm-top-packages] by both dependents and PageRank.

My favorite example of adoption is that Apple now
[**supports JSON5 _natively_**][apple-allowjson5] across iOS and macOS. ü§Ø
(They even [extended it][apple-extension] for convenience.)



:---:|:---:
[![Apple docs for `allowJSON5`](/images/json5/apple-allowsJSON5.png)][apple-allowjson5] | [![Apple docs for `assumeTopLevelDictionary`, a JSON5 extension](/images/json5/apple-assumesTopLevelDictionary.png)][apple-extension]

[apple-allowjson5]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder/3766916-allowsjson5
[apple-extension]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder/3766917-assumestopleveldictionary

This moderate success for an open-source project didn't come overnight, and it wasn't obvious to predict.
On the contrary, JSON5 was thoroughly dismissed, rejected, and even hated at first,
and much of the community proclaimed it dead on arrival.

The results: 1M to 20M to now 60M weekly downloads
5,000 stars on GitHub, X contributors
Top 500 depended upon on npm
Used by Babel, React Native, Chromium, Next.js
Requested for VS Code and .NET
And now supported natively by Apple across all their OSes in both Swift and Objective-C. Hell yeah ‚Äî this is my favorite
(My dream would still be package.json5)

This past month was the 10-year anniversary of [JSON5](https://json5.org/),
an open-source project I founded to make one aspect of software engineering a little easier.

I won't get into the technical details here or share the whole pitch for the project.
It simply aimed to fix a small but real problem that I felt.

After chewing on this problem for a year, I finally bit the bullet and coded up this project one free Sunday.
I shared it to [Hacker News][hn] that night, an online community of fellow software engineers,
and this was the reception that I got:

A couple of weeks ago, 10-year anniversary passed of JSON5

I was sitting in Julian Walker‚Äôs apartment, working from home one early morning at his dining table. I‚Äôd been hacking on this thing for a few days? Weeks? (Look at commit history)

Published it to hacker news (show Hn link). Developer center

So much hate and vitriol! Horrible, an abomination

Mitchell Hashimoto, founder of HashiCorp and creator of _several_ entrepreneurial industry-changing open-source projects (open-source, right?), went out of his way to make a parody project making fun of JSON5 (and mentioning me by name in the credits). This was especially fascinating given (a) that he‚Äôs a creator himself ‚Äî a ‚Äúman (person) in the arena‚Äù in Teddy Roosevelt‚Äôs words ‚Äî not solely a critic, and (b) the depths (?) he went to express his dislike for my project.

To be clear, I wasn‚Äôt offended by it, maybe more surprised and a little shell-shocked, and I don‚Äôt hold any grudge, but Mitchell‚Äôs behavior then also isn‚Äôt something I aspire to, admire, or respect. (Do I want to say this?) maybe say it was funny, maybe that he never apologized and I never asked for an apology, maybe that it‚Äôs also a bit telling that the project has since been deleted (maybe not?).

This was so interesting to me because the problems seemed so‚Ä¶ clear and obvious. I‚Äôd even gone out of my way to acknowledge from the start that I wasn‚Äôt the first person to think of these ideas (I was maybe just the first to act on them). And yet so many people were disagreeing with me on even the _premise_ that these problems were legit, much less worth solving in this way. I didn‚Äôt know the term ‚Äúgaslighting‚Äù at the time (Wikipedia article), but in hindsight, I probably felt gaslit a bit.

Somehow, for whatever reasons (maybe pride? Na√Øvet√©? I‚Äôm not sure), I ignored the haters and stuck with it. Tweet timeline: iterated a bunch, opened up to maintainers for the first time, made org, Jordan Tucker took over and did amazing work

Lessons:

1. Ignore the haters. Link to Superhuman‚Äôs PMF article, applies to dating also and job searches and hiring candidates: don‚Äôt spend your time and energy trying to convince/close/win people that are unwinnable. (You probably still have to build something people want/love. Scratching your own itch, solving a problem you _know_ exists and experience yourself is a great short-circuit for that.)
2. We‚Äôre all blind
3. Share your legos. Invite others in, let go, delegate. Jordan




Heather Arthur example



Resistance to change
Maybe software engineers in particular are often curmudgeonly, pessimistic, cynical


Tweet timeline



Ignore the haters
Even experts like Mitchell‚Ä¶ hard to predict the future. Mitchell‚Äôs experience had been far more with Ruby and YAML and far less with JavaScript and JSON. We‚Äôre all blind touching different parts of an elephant. Stay humble and embrace different perspectives.
